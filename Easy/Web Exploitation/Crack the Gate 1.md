Start the instance and visit the website

Information we know:

1. A CTF player hid sensitive data inside a restricted web portal.

2. Email of the CTF Player: `ctf-player@picoctf.org`

3. we don’t know the password

4. Developer left a secret

Our login page looks like this

We open dev tools (Ctrl+Shift+I) and see a unusal comment `ABGR: Wnpx - grzcbenel olcnff: hfr urnqre "K-Qri-Npprff: lrf"` followed with the sentence `Remove before pushing to production!`. 

This could reveal some secret information

The comment ` ABGR: Wnpx - grzcbenel olcnff: hfr urnqre "K-Qri-Npprff: lrf" ` looks like ROT13

We use cyberchef to read the plain text of this comment

And it says that we can temporarliy bypass the login using a header `"X-Dev-Access: yes"`

We first try a random password with the email we already know

We open Networks tab in dev tools and copy the request as curl

And we add the following at the end of the curl `-H 'X-Dev-Access: yes' `

And now we can see the flag `picoCTF{brut4_f0rc4_3c6b118b}`

<img width="1554" height="367" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fd5a046-303a-4051-8cb1-6feaad5a2951" />
