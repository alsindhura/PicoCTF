We go to the Web page and find a login form. Here we try some random creds
![login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cd6ac1c-e168-4c6e-a74a-31e077445754)

And once we click Login button, we get an error that "Login failed"
![failed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/720868f9-8128-4679-9a2c-1a081a16cbad)

Now we open dev tools and we find a dynamically-loaded script called `script.js` and we inspect this script, we find that this script has username and password 
Username: `admin`
Password: `strongPassword098765`
![password](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd71ac4b-26b2-4810-ab4c-c2fd43eb5121)

And now we use this creds to login and then we are taken to a page called `admin.php`
![login(1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ebe66ba-4484-43b6-91eb-51d31d188217)

There we find a flag

![flag](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92f8ec4b-4679-4590-8cb5-ed228fe35159)
 Flag: ` picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_a8788e61}`
