We go to the web page and we will land on `Home` page

We will then inspect Home page

But we find nothing. From the hints we see that we need to use other included pages and we go to `About` page first
![2(1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/987ad4de-6bb9-4aff-a357-6679cbbf702a)

And now we inspect the `About` page and we noticed a custom attribute named `notify_true` attached to the `<section>` tag. The value of this attribute is a long alphanumeric string:

```
<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZjZmNmI3OGF9">
  <h1>
    Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there
  </h1>
  <!-- .about-container -->
</section>
```
![insp2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31ec07d2-0b3a-482d-9951-acbc717b90b1)
Alphanumeric String: `cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZjZmNmI3OGF9`

We go to the website https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier and find that the text in `notify_true` is encoded in Base64

Now we decode the text and get the flag

Flag: `picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_f6f6b78a}`
